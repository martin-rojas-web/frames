            <h2>Introduction: Understanding Psychological Manipulation</h2>
            <p>Psychological manipulation is a pervasive threat that aims to exploit your emotions, weaknesses, and insecurities to serve another person's agenda. In this article, we focus on one of the most harmful forms of manipulation, which involves imposing 'narrative frames of personal worthlessness.' This aims to erode your self-esteem and sense of self-worth to leave you vulnerable and susceptible to further control. We discuss the signs to watch out for, provide examples of such frames, and outline the types of individuals who might employ them.</p>

            <h2>What Are Narrative Frames of Personal Worthlessness?</h2>
            <p>These narrative frames attempt to convince you of your inherent inadequacy and undesirability. They often include statements that intimate you can't change, grow, or improve. Some common narrative frames of worthlessness include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"You are fundamentally broken."</li>
                <li>"You will never improve or heal."</li>
                <li>"Your worth is conditional and must be validated externally."</li>
                <li>"You are inherently unlovable or undesirable."</li>
                <li>"You are powerless to change your reality."</li>
                <li>"You are fundamentally inferior to others."</li>
                <li>"You deserve mistreatment or abuse."</li>
                <li>"Your mistakes define you permanently."</li>
                <li>"You are unworthy of happiness or success."</li>
            </ul>
