                <h2>Introduction: Understanding Psychological Manipulation</h2>
                <p>Psychological manipulation seeks to influence your thoughts, emotions, and decisions to benefit the
                    manipulator. Narrative frames are a common tool used in manipulation, shaping your perspective and
                    guiding your behavior. This category, Frames Promoting Passivity & Inaction, encourages avoidance
                    and stagnation by emphasizing the potential dangers of action, promoting comfort zone preservation,
                    and discouraging risk-taking or challenge.</p>

                <h2>What Are Narrative Frames Promoting Passivity & Inaction?</h2>
                <p>Narrative frames of Passivity & Inaction are stories or statements that advocate for avoiding action,
                    maintaining the status quo, and prioritizing security over growth. These frames often present
                    uncertainty, change, and risk-taking as inherently dangerous, promoting inaction as the safest and
                    most reasonable choice. Examples of frames within this category include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Waiting passively resolves life's most important challenges."</li>
                    <li>"You shouldn't act until you're absolutely sure about everything."</li>
                    <li>"Comfort zone preservation is more important than growth."</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Spotting the Signs: How to Identify These Frames?</h2>

                    the potential negative consequences of action, while downplaying the risks of stagnation or missed
                    opportunities.</p>
