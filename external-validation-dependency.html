                <h2>Introduction: Understanding Psychological Manipulation</h2>
                <p>Psychological manipulation is a potent threat that takes advantage of emotions, weaknesses, and
                    insecurities to serve another individual's interest. In this piece, we delve into one of the more
                    covert forms of manipulation, namely 'narrative frames of external validation dependency.' These
                    frames aim to weaken personal autonomy and make one's self-worth entirely conditional on external
                    approval. By the end of the article, you'll be able to recognize these frames, identify potential
                    actors who might use them and take steps to protect yourself.</p>

                <h2>What Are Narrative Frames of External Validation Dependency?</h2>
                <p>These frames revolve around tying your self-worth to the validation and opinions of others. They work
                    subtly to erode self-confidence and decision-making abilities, making you heavily dependent on
                    external feedback for self-worth. Here are a few examples of such narrative frames:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"You must always please everyone around you."</li>
                    <li>"Approval from others defines your worth."</li>
                    <li>"Criticism from others means you are worthless."</li>
                    <li>"You cannot self-validate; outsiders must confirm your value."</li>
                    <li>"You should change yourself completely according to others' desires."</li>
                    <li>"Always put others’ perception above your self-respect."</li>
                    <li>"You must pursue popularity above authenticity."</li>
                    <li>"Your happiness depends entirely on others’ approval."</li>
                    <li>"Others’ opinions about you always outweigh your intuition."</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Changes in behavior or self-presentation to suit others</li>
                </ul>
