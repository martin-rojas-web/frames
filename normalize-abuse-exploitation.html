                <h2>Introduction: Understanding Psychological Manipulation</h2>
                <p>Psychological manipulation is a technique used to control your emotions, behaviors, and decisions for
                    the manipulator's benefit. Narrative frames, a specific type of manipulation, shape your perception
                    of situations to influence your mindset and actions. This particular category, Frames that Normalize
                    Abuse & Exploitation, promote acceptance of harmful behavior by minimizing its severity, normalizing
                    abusive dynamics, and undermining your right to self-defense.</p>

                <h2>What Are Narrative Frames that Normalize Abuse & Exploitation?</h2>
                <p>Narrative frames that Normalize Abuse & Exploitation are statements or stories that reduce the
                    significance of abusive behavior, blame victims, and promote complacency in the face of harm. These
                    frames often create an environment where abuse is tolerated, leaving victims vulnerable and
                    perpetrators unaccountable. Examples of frames within this category include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Abusive behavior is normal or deserved."</li>
                    <li>"Mistreatment is justified by your own inadequacies."</li>
                    <li>"Manipulation is acceptable from supposedly superior people."</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Spotting the Signs: How to Identify These Frames?</h2>
                <p>These frames often use language that minimizes the seriousness of abuse, shifts responsibility onto
                    the victim, or glorifies harmful behaviors. They present abusive dynamics as the norm, making it
                    difficult for those affected to recognize and resist exploitation.</p>

                <h2>Protecting Your Mental Wellbeing</h2>
                <p>To protect yourself from these frames, learn to recognize healthy boundaries and assert your right to
                    safety and respect. Understand that abuse is never your fault and that no one deserves to be
                    mistreated. Seek support from trusted friends, family members, or professionals who can help you
                    identify and navigate abusive situations.</p>
                <p>Emphasize self-care by practicing healthy coping mechanisms, such as journaling, mindfulness, or
                    engaging in activities that bring joy and fulfillment. Work on building self-confidence and
                    resilience, remember that you are worthy of love and respect, and don't hesitate to distance
                    yourself from individuals who perpetuate these harmful narratives.</p>
