                <h2>What Are Narrative Frames of Helplessness and Victimhood?</h2>
                <p>Narrative frames of helplessness and victimhood aim to convince us that we lack control over our
                    lives, emotions, and decisions. They create a mindset of hopelessness, leaving us dependent on
                    external factors or individuals for validation, rescue, or progress. Some common narrative frames in
                    this category include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Circumstances control your destiny completely."</li>
                    <li>"Others dictate your emotional state permanently."</li>
                    <li>"You must wait for someone else to save you."</li>
                    <li>"You are incapable of overcoming lifeâ€™s trials."</li>
                    <li>"You can never escape your past."</li>
                    <li>"You have no agency or responsibility whatsoever."</li>
                    <li>"You must rely entirely on external rescue."</li>
                    <li>"You are inevitably doomed by fate."</li>
                    <li>"Life is unfair, and you can't influence outcomes."</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Spotting the Signs: How to Identify These Frames?</h2>
                <p>Look out for repeated occurrences of messages which suggest you are powerless, either communicated
                    directly or subtly through stories and images. Here are some key indicators that can help identify
                    these frames:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Statements that make you feel incapable of influencing your outcomes</li>
                    <li>Language that portrays you as a victim of circumstances, permanence of emotional distress</li>
                    <li>Discouragement of individual action, responsibility or self-efficacy</li>
                    <li>Narratives which exaggerate the permanence of defeat or victimization</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Principal Evil Actors: Who Might Use These Frames?</h2>
                <p>Particular groups and individuals who might employ these narrative frames:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Toxic relationship partners: In various relationships, manipulative individuals might use these
                        frames to maintain a power imbalance, making the other partner more dependent.</li>
                    <li>Political figures: In some cases, politicians or political groups might exploit perceptions of
                        victimhood or helplessness to gain support or sympathy.</li>
                    <li>Media platforms: Some media outlets may use these frames to generate fear and increase their
                        audience's reliance on them for news and opinions.</li>
                    <li>False saviors, cult leaders, and gurus: False saviors may capitalize on feelings of dependence
                        by offering themselves as the "source of rescue."</li>
