                <h2>Introduction: Understanding Psychological Manipulation</h2>
                <p>Psychological manipulation aims to control your thoughts, emotions, and actions for the manipulator's
                    gain. Narrative frames are one tool used in manipulation to shape perspective and guide reactions.
                    This category, Frames Supporting Addictive & Destructive Habits, promotes self-destructive behavior
                    by undermining self-control, perpetuating hopelessness, and suggesting that addiction is inevitable.

                <h2>What Are Narrative Frames Supporting Addictive & Destructive Habits?</h2>
                <p>Narrative frames that Support Addictive & Destructive Habits are stories or statements that emphasize
                    the powerlessness of individuals to resist unhealthy impulses, prioritize instant gratification over
                    long-term benefits, and present self-destructive behavior as an understandable coping mechanism.
                    These frames undermine personal agency and often depict recovery as unattainable. Examples of frames
                    within this category include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"You can't overcome your addictions."</li>
                    <li>"Your impulses control your behavior completely."</li>
                    <li>"Immediate gratification is superior to long-term health."</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Spotting the Signs: How to Identify These Frames?</h2>
                <p>These frames often use language that denies personal choice, minimizes the severity of addictive
                    behavior, and rejects the possibility of change. They depict addiction or self-destructive habits as
                    an innate, uncontrollable aspect of the individual.</p>
