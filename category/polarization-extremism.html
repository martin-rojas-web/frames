                <h2>Introduction: Understanding Psychological Manipulation</h2>
                <p>Psychological manipulation is a pervasive tactic that seeks to control your thoughts, emotions, and
                    behaviors for the benefit of the manipulator. Narrative frames are powerful tools used in
                    manipulation to influence perspective and guide reactions. This specific category, Frames of
                    Polarization & Extremism, promotes an "us versus them" mindset and discourages compromise, dialogue,
                    and empathy.</p>

                <h2>What Are Narrative Frames of Polarization & Extremism?</h2>
                <p>Narrative frames of Polarization & Extremism present stories or statements that emphasize dichotomous
                    thinking, vilification of opposing viewpoints, and the escalation of conflict. These frames often
                    create a hostile environment where understanding and cooperation are difficult to achieve. Examples
                    of frames within this category include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Compromise or nuance reveals weakness."</li>
                    <li>"Anyone who disagrees is automatically evil."</li>
                    <li>"Opposing views have no legitimate value."</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Spotting the Signs: How to Identify These Frames?</h2>
                <p>These frames often use language that reinforces dichotomous thinking, labels opponents as immoral or
                    subhuman, and dismisses the possibility of common ground. They may suggest that dialogue or
                    compromise is inherently wrong or dangerous.</p>
