                <h2>Introduction: Understanding Psychological Manipulation</h2>
                <p>Manipulation is an attempt to sway someone's emotions or beliefs to serve the manipulator's interests. Psychological manipulation can be subtle, making it challenging to detect. One method of manipulation involves the use of narrative frames, which structure reality in a certain way to influence perception and behavior. This particular category, Frames of Power Inequality & Submission, promotes obedience and submission to authority without question.</p>

                <h2>Protecting Your Mental Wellbeing</h2>
                <p>To protect yourself from manipulation through these frames, it's important to uphold your own sense of self-worth and personal agency. Remember that authority figures are not infallible and that questioning authority is not inherently disrespectful or immoral. Respectful disagreement and dialogue are healthy and necessary for personal autonomy and a balanced society.</p>
                <p>Regularly examine the narratives you're presented with and consider their implications. Reflect on your own beliefs and values, and resist accepting narratives that would negate your agency or diminish your inherent worth. Seek out environments that encourage respectful discussion and value diverse perspectives.</p>
