                <h2>Introduction: Understanding Psychological Manipulation</h2>
                <p>Psychological manipulation aims to control your emotions, beliefs, and actions for the manipulator's
                    benefit. Narrative frames are tools used in manipulation to influence perspective and guide
                    reactions. This specific category, Frames of Fear & Anxiety Promotion, cultivates a heightened sense
                    of danger and vulnerability to foster compliance and control.</p>

                <h2>What Are Narrative Frames of Fear & Anxiety Promotion?</h2>
                <p>Narrative frames of Fear & Anxiety Promotion present stories or statements that emphasize constant
                    threat, uncertainty, and vulnerability to instill fear and promote cautious or paranoid behavior.
                    These frames often create an environment where personal growth and freedom are stifled, and
                    decisions are driven by anxiety. Examples of frames within this category include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"The world is unceasingly threatening and hostile."</li>
                    <li>"Everything unfamiliar is dangerous and must be avoided."</li>
                    <li>"Constant worry or fear is necessary and justified."</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Spotting the Signs: How to Identify These Frames?</h2>
                <p>These frames often use language that exaggerates danger, reinforces mistrust, and cultivates a sense
                    of impending disaster. They may suggest that fear is a necessary and appropriate response in most
                    situations, and downplay personal resilience or adaptability.</p>
